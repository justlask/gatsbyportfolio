title: "DOSTED"
description: "is an app that believes in the power of everyone Doing One Small Thing Every Day to make the world a better place."
builtWith: "React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Heroku, Cloudinary, Google Maps API, ipstack API"
problem: "The news seems to be focused on reminding people about the world's problems. A lot of problems, many questions, and not a lot of solutions. Changing the world is a huge task. And like all other tasks, can be managed better when broken into smaller tasks. So let's do that!"
solution: "Gamify changing the world by Doing One Small Thing Every Day (DOSTED). Users are given a simple small task every day to complete. And it's basic math! The more users that do one small thing every day, the more exponential the change and therefore the better the world will be."
code: "The fun part of this app was creating the logic to handle 'streak' points, adding a point if a task was done within 24-48 hours, clearing points if a task was done after 48 hours, and doing nothing if a task was done before 24 hours. I also was able to use the ipStack API to calculate the users location, taking that information to generate a pin which I was then able to render on a map using Google Maps API to show where in the world people are DOSTING."
