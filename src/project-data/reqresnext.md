description: "is a project management platform for small dev teams."
builtWith: "React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Heroku"
problem: "When I was getting ready to start a new solo project, I realized that there was no project management tool that was highly geared to a team of one, or even to a team of a few. Most large teams use not only one tool, but many. And that's great, but for a small project, it can become too much to keep track of - I wanted something simple."
solution: "We needed a project management tool that better emphasized the whole process, including being able to better visualize designs. And importantly, to easily see the project’s progress from a bird’s eye view. So I decided to emphasize the Project, Action, Task model for organizing development."
code: "There are many interconnected moving parts in project management, and therefore there is a great need to keep things organized. And although there are many pieces and information models, I aimed to create the most minimal visualization and easiest 'flow' possible. This includes keeping all components nicely organized in their own folders."
