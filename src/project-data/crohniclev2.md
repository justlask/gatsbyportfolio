title: "Crohnicle v2"
description: "is a social network for people with chronic illnesses to find friends and create groups for support and activities."
builtWith: "React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Heroku, Cloudinary, Cypress"
problem: "Having a chronic condition can be lonely, often people are hesitant to talk about them on existing social networks, as to not overwhelm their friends. Some people do use existing social networks to connect with others, but there is no easy way to both find others with the same condition and find events and groups."
solution: "Create a social network dedicated to serving the needs of those with chronic conditions. Creating a dedicated space for users to be able to connect with others, find groups and events. Allowing users to sort and find users with the same or similar conditions, medications and locations."
code: "This project is currently in development. This project is done using functional components and hooks. I also integrated some testing with Cypress.io. I also wanted to take the time to not only design the system architecture but also to take the time to have a beautiful user interface"
