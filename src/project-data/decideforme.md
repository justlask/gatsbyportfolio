title: "Decide For Me"
description: "is a gif-tastic task list that aims to keep task management fun and lighthearted."
builtWith: "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Axios, Giphy API, Bored API"
problem: "To do lists can be really boring. And some things that you have to do are really boring, or you just may not be in the mood to do them. It's why some people have trouble 'adult-ing.' Adult-ing ususally isn't 'fun.'"
solution: "People like GIFs. They make everything more fun! Reduce decision fatigue by picking their next task for them. Serve up a gif related to the task they are given and make them laugh when they get their task."
code: "Users add tasks that they need to do, which get added to a list. We randomly pick a task, search for a gif that matches the task with giphy API. Then, we use that gif as a background to make telling them what task they have to do next more enjoyable!"
