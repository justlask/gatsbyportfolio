title: "Crohnicle v1"
description: "is a social network for people with chronic conditions to find friends and create groups for support and activities."
builtWith: "Handlebars, Express, Node, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Heroku"
problem: "Having a chronic condition can be lonely, often people are hesitant to talk about them on existing social networks, as to not overwhelm their friends. Some people do use existing social networks to connect with others, but there is no easy way to both find others with the same condition as well as find events and groups."
solution: "Create a social network dedicated to serving the needs of those with chronic conditions. Creating a dedicated space for users to be able to connect with others, find groups and events. Allowing users to sort and find users with the same or similar conditions, medications and locations."
code: "I spent time to ensure that small details were completed, such as not allowing users to friend themselves, and allowing only group/event members to see the comment section. My favorite part of this project is the ability to sort through and find other users by medications or by condition."
