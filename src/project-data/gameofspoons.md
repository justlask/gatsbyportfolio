title: "Game of Spoons"
description: "is a text and choice based game exploring the reality of living with a chronic illness."
builtWith: "JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery"
problem: "When you have a chronic illness 'simple choices' or 'simple tasks' can require more thought. Anyone can suffer from burnout, but when you have a chronic illness burnout can also start or worsen a flare up, which can lead to hospitalization. Explaining this to people can be difficult."
solution: "Take the spoon theory and gamify it. Allow people to 'experience' a week with a chronic illness. Spoons are 'energy,' each day you will be given a random amount of spoons to use, as some days are better/worse than others. The goal is to make it through the week with a positive number of spoons."
code: "There are a series of scenarios which the user goes through, they are given two choices, each with a different cost. Depending on the day of the week, different functions are called to make gameplay possible. The total number of spoons is kept track of throughout the game, and a function controls the user graphic which changes based upon the total number of spoons."
